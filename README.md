## Part A
Energy filtering is applied to secondary electrons by the **mirror electrode**.  
Only electrons below the mirror electrode applied low pass filter are detected.  
A secondary electron image is taken at this mirror voltage setting.  

## Part B
Images are taken sequentially, while stepping the mirror electrode bias, to build the hyperspectral image volume.

## Part C
Secondary electron spectra are made by differentiating emission intensity with respect to energy.  
Location specific secondary electron spectra are produced from regions of the image volume.

The working principal of Secondary Electron Hyperspectral Imaging is energy filtering in the SEM (scanning electron microscope) column.

## Part A
Energy filtering is applied to secondary electrons by the **mirror electrode** (part a in figure below).  
Only electrons below the mirror electrode low pass filter are detected.  
A secondary electron image is taken at this mirror voltage setting.  

## Part B
Images are taken sequentially to build the hyperspectral image volume.

## Part C
Secondary electron spectra are made from regions of the image volume.
